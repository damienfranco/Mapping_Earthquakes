# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The goal of this project was to help Basil and Sadhana build an interactive earthquake map where earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes could be viewed in three different perspectives. In order to visualize earthquake proximity to tectonic plates, mapbox API/GeoJSON data was utilized.

## Results
